# Computer-Vison-CS780

● Operated images processing on Grayscale images and Binary images on low-level vision;
● Performed image filtering in noise suppression by using Gaussian Smoothing, Median Filter, Mode Filter on Grayscale images; and applied Morphological operation technique Dilation, Erosion, closing and opening to remove noise for images; 
● Selected accurate threshold by using Deepest Concavity and Bi-Means Gaussian Curve Fitting threshold selection under with histogram;
● using C++ and Java programming language to Implement Edge Detection Operation, Robert's Operator, Sobel's Operator, Gradient, Zero-Crossing, Canny's Operator, and Binary Edge Detector.
● Compressed images and Recognized images by applying Medial Axis & Distance Transfer algorithm; Which processed the GrayScale images with two passes operation, local maxima operation and then create skeleton image compression;
● Programmed morphological operation Thinning to reduce the thickness of the image and detect the edge of the object. 
● Simulated line detection operation according to the Hough Transform Line Detection Algorithm(self-driving cars use it). 
● Compressed images and analyze object by utilizing Chain-Code, which can be used for lossless compression for monochrome images, and object recognition via boundary Pattern analysis;
● Coded K-Curvature Corner Detector algorithm and Maximum Archord Distance to detect the corner of objects;
● Used Document Zone Classification, Pattern Recognition, and character recognition to recognize the different part of a document(text, figure, photo, math, table);
● Applied algorithms on Robotic Picking Up Boxes, Self-Driving Cars see the roads and Vacuums vacuum the floors based on the edges they detect. 
● Applied Statistic Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning to inspect and make decision for making important Economic decision;
